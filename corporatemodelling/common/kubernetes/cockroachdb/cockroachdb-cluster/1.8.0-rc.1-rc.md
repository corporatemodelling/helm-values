# CockroachDB Cluster

This Helm chart will install a CockroachDB cluster.

## Pre-requisites

This uses the [CockroachDB K8S operator](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator), so that needs to be installed first:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator/master/install/crds.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator/master/install/operator.yaml
```

It also requires [Derrer](https://github.com/peeveen/derrer) to be installed first, so you should install that too.

```bash
helm install derrer oci://registry-1.docker.io/peeveen/derrer --version=1.0.0
```

## Installation

See the `values.yaml` for the configuration options.

```bash
helm install cockroachdb-cluster oci://cr.corporatemodelling.com/corporatemodelling/common/kubernetes/cockroachdb/cockroachdb-cluster --version=[desired_version]
```

## SQL Initialization Jobs

In the `init.sql` section of `values.yaml`, you can define a number of initialization tasks. Each of these takes the form of a
chunk of SQL (provided via a secret, config map, or raw string) that will be run when the cluster has started and is available
for connection.

You can specify multiple initialization tasks that might depend on initialization performed by other tasks in the collection. There is "order" that the tasks are run in: they are all run simultaneously.
Each initialization task is done by a Kubernetes `Job` that has a `restartPolicy` of `OnFailure`, so they will continue to
be run until they succeed. To take advantage of this functionality, ensure you write initialization SQL that **will** fail if
dependencies are missing: **don't** write commands with, for example, `IF EXISTS` guards, because if your initialization task succeeds
without doing what it was intended to do, it will **not** be run again.

## Additional Users

The `additionalUsers` section of `values.yaml` can be used to create any number of users. Each entry in
the list should contain a `name` for the user, and, optionally, a `password`.

Each user defined in this section will have their own client certificate/key secret added to the cluster,
and an appropriate `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS` command will be added to an SQL initialization task. Any
specific `GRANT`s that are required should be defined in your own custom initialization task.

## Persistent Volume Claims

When you install, one or more persistent volume claims will be created. See the `pvc` section in `values.yaml` for some configuration options.

These claims will obviously need to find appropriate volumes to bind to. You should create these beforehand ...

### Persistent Volumes

... or you can get this chart to create them for you. If you supply `true` as the value for `pv.create`,
some `local`-type persistent volumes will be created. The path prefix for each local volume should be provided in `pv.hostPath`. Each volume that is created will append a zero-based index to this.

#### Minikube

Example Minikube setup. Here, we create some folders, within the Minikube host, suffixed with 0, 1, 2, etc.

> In this example, `pv.hostPath` would be set to `/home/docker/db-data-`

### Known Problems

If creating a multi-node cluster (`clusterSize` > 2), the CockroachDB operator that creates the persistent volume claims doesn't clean them up properly, so they will still be present when you
uninstall the chart. You have to manually remove them.

Additionally, if you switch between single- and multi-node installations, any persisted data will
likely be invalid for your new cluster, so you should manually delete that also.
